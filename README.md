This is the repository for maintaining the TAF/TAP-TSI data catalogue owned by the railway business sector.
The sector-owned data catalogue is based on the official TAF/TAP-TSI Data Catalogue baseline published by ERA (European Railway Agency).
All the changes to the sector-owned schema are tracked in this repository. 
The only one with the right to commit is the Change Manager of the Joint Sector Group Support Management Office of the railway industry sector.
